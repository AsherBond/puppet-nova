    The ``modular_libvirt`` parameter now defaults to true on Red Hat family
    operating systems. As of RHEL9, it is recommended to use modular libvirt
    daemons, while the monolithic daemon has been deprecated. Note that
    the current manifests do not fully manage the transition from monolithic
    daemon to modular libvirt daemons, and additional cleanup may be needed.
